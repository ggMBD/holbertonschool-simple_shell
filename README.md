## Introduction

The Holberton Simple Shell Project is an educational endeavor to learn about operating systems and the fundamentals of shell programming. This shell implementation allows users to interact with the underlying operating system through text-based commands.

## Features

- Basic shell commands execution.
- Command execution with arguments and options.
- Error handling and reporting.
- Custom prompt for user input.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```c
   https://github.com/ggMBD/holbertonschool-simple_shell

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```c
   cd holbertonschool-simple_shell
3. Compile the shell program:
  
   ```c
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
  
4. Run the shell:
   ```c
   ./hsh
   ```
You'll be greeted by the custom shell prompt. Enter commands and press Enter to execute them.

## Code Snippets

Here are a few snippets that demonstrate how some of the supported commands are implemented in our Simple Shell:

### `env` Command

```c
#include "shell.h"

/**
 * execute_ls - print the "env" in stdout.
 */
void _env(void)
{
	int i;

	for (i = 0; environ[i] != NULL; i++)
	{
		printf("%s\n", environ[i]);
	}
}
```

# Supported Commands
## The Holberton Simple Shell Project supports the following commands:

- ***ls:*** List files and directories in the current directory.
- ***pwd:*** Print the current working directory.
- **echo:** Display a message on the screen.
- **exit:** Exit the shell.
## Installation
* Ensure you have gcc (GNU Compiler Collection) installed.
* Clone the repository as explained in the Usage section.
* Compile the shell source files using the provided compilation command.
* Run the compiled executable to start using the shell.
